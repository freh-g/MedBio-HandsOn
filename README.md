# MEDBIO_HandsOn

In this repo there is the material for a lesson on conducting an association analysis running plink and interpretation of the results. This lessons have been created in collaboration with [Roger Compte Boixader](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roger-compte-boixader/) and have been taught at [VPH Summer School](https://www.vph-institute.org/events/6th-vph-summer-school.html) at Universitat Pompeu Fabra in Barcelona during an Hands-On. The data comes from [PLINK website](https://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/res.shtml#teach).

For the network propagation part we use [guild algorithm]( https://github.com/emreg00/guild).
